inputs/
================================================================================

This directory is where any input decks required by the benchmark collection
will reside.  For now, it is a hot mess full of the bits and pieces that can be
used to test individual benchmarks at NERSC on different HPC and storage
platforms.  It will be cleaned up in the coming days.
